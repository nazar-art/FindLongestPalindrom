After running this program it show next prompt:

For the start enter number of file which you want to check for longest palindrom:
1 - "Alice in Wonderland" by Lewis Carroll
2 - file with few knowen english palindromes
q - for quit

if you enter wishe  number it prints for you longest pallindrom from this file as:

    The longest palindrom is:
    • Madam, I’m Adam

For suggestion choose you have two files. "Alice in Wonderland" doesn't contain a lot of palindromes ;)
But content of last file is special and easy:

    Typical examples of palindromes are:
    • A man, a plan, a canal—Panama!
    • Go hang a salami, I’m a lasagna hog.
    and, of course, the oldest palindrome of all:
    • Madam, I’m Adam.

It's the famouse knowen english palindromes.
